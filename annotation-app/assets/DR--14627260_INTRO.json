However, according to the Fourth National Survey on Sexual Harassment in Australian Workplaces conducted by the Australian Human Rights Commission, sexual harassment is a prevalent issue in Australian workplaces. The report found that one in six women and one in eleven men experienced sexual harassment in the last 12 months. The report also highlighted that women who are of low economic status, from migrant backgrounds, or have limited career mobility are among the most vulnerable groups. The report suggests that the current legislation has failed in preventing this kind of conduct, and more needs to be done to address the issue.","system":"experiment_1e","overall_rating":1,"Is an answer provided?":"","The answer is relevant to the question (regardless of whether the details are correct or not).":"","This answer is useful and helpful to address this question.":"","The answer contains enough information for the question.":"","The answer completely answers the whole question (e.g., it covers every aspect of the question).":"","The answer is missing specific details from the document.":"","The answer is wordy (e.g., unnecessarily long or contains unnecessary words).":"","The answer is easy to read and comprehend.":"","The answer contains inaccurate information (e.g., information that is made up or not true).":"","The answer contains information not found in the document (e.g., information that does not exist in this document).":"","The answer contains irrelevant information (e.g., information that is irrelevant).":"","The answer has been written by an expert.":"","I can trust this answer":""}]},"q2":{"text":"What do you know about Maurice Blackburn Pty Ltd?","index":0,"answers":[{"text":"Maurice Blackburn Pty Ltd is a plaintiff law firm with 32 permanent offices and 29 visiting offices throughout all mainland States and Territories in Australia.

Changes to the regulatory environment in relation to online workplace-related sexual and sex-based harassment must include enforceable sanctions against employers who fail in their duty to provide a safe workplace for their employees.\n\n2. The governing bodies of all organizations should be fully aware of the incidence of sexual harassment in their workplace, and they should be required to report on the number of reported incidents of sexual harassment, as part of their reporting requirements to Workplace Gender Equality Agency (‘WGEA’).\n\n3. The current legislated timeframe for making a complaint through AHRC is unworkable and out of step with other legislative provisions. A complainant should be given the right to elect to bypass the AHRC and proceed straight to court.\n\n4. It should be made abundantly clear, via legislative reform or through delegated legislation, that regulators are required to investigate sexual harassment complaints given the health and safety implications of same.\n\n5. Maurice Blackburn recommends that changes to the regulatory environment in relation to online workplace-related sexual and sex-based harassment must include enforceable sanctions against employers who fail in their duty to provide a safe workplace for their employees.\n\n6. The AHRC should recommend a process for formally requiring that reporting of sexual harassment claims and statistics be made to the board of the defined entity and to an external organization.\n\n7. Businesses should also be required to report on the number of reported incidents of sexual harassment, as part of their reporting requirements to WGEA.","system":"experiment_1e","overall_rating":1,"Is an answer provided?":"","The answer is relevant to the question (regardless of whether the details are correct or not).":"","This answer is useful and helpful to address this question.":"","The answer contains enough information for the question.":"","The answer completely answers the whole question (e.g., it covers every aspect of the question).":"","The answer is missing specific details from the document.":"","The answer is wordy (e.g., unnecessarily long or contains unnecessary words).":"","The answer is easy to read and comprehend.":"","The answer contains inaccurate information (e.g., information that is made up or not true).":"","The answer contains information not found in the document (e.g., information that does not exist in this document).":"","The answer contains irrelevant information (e.g., information that is irrelevant).":"","The answer has been written by an expert.":"","I can trust this answer":""}]},"q5":{"text":"Discuss in brief Maurice Blackburn's responses to Terms of Reference?","index":0,"answers":[{"text":"Maurice Blackburn is a plaintiff law firm that specializes in personal injuries, medical negligence, employment and industrial law, dust diseases, superannuation, negligent financial and other advice, and consumer and commercial class actions. In response to the Terms of Reference, Maurice Blackburn has expressed concern about the impacts of online workplace-related sexual and sex-based harassment on many Australians under the current, mostly unregulated online environment. They believe that the burden currently borne by victims to enforce their rights should be more evenly shared between victims, employees, and employers. They also believe that one of the significant failings of the current legislative scheme is the onus it places on victims to seek redress for the harm they have suffered, rather than placing a positive obligation on employers to prevent the harm occurring in the first instance. Maurice Blackburn is of the view that there should be enforceable sanctions against employers who fail in their duty to provide a safe workplace for their employees. They have engaged with a number of organizations such as NOW Australia and Unions NSW, who share their goal of preventing sexual harassment from occurring in Australian workplaces and securing justice for victims.","system":"experiment_1e","overall_rating":1,"Is an answer provided?":"","The answer is relevant to the question (regardless of whether the details are correct or not).":"","This answer is useful and helpful to address this question.":"","The answer contains enough information for the question.":"","The answer completely answers the whole question (e.g., it covers every aspect of the question).":"","The answer is missing specific details from the document.":"","The answer is wordy (e.g., unnecessarily long or contains unnecessary words).":"","The answer is easy to read and comprehend.":"","The answer contains inaccurate information (e.g., information that is made up or not true).":"","The answer contains information not found in the document (e.g., information that does not exist in this document).":"","The answer contains irrelevant information (e.g., information that is irrelevant).":"","The answer has been written by an expert.":"","I can trust this answer":""}]},"q6":{"text":"Why does the writer call online workplace environment as unregulated?","index":0,"answers":[{"text":"The writer calls the online workplace environment as unregulated because there are no clear regulations or laws in place to prevent or punish online workplace-related sexual and sex-based harassment.

Responding to online media does not encourage introspection or the tempering of language or behavior. Threats or harassment made online seem to be held to a different standard of accountability than if they were made via any other mechanism.",

Journalists are frequently expected by their employers to participate in online discussions that emanate from their story. Some employees have reported that employers expect them to express personal opinions in relation to online stories. These ‘forced’ interactions are exposing media professionals to online workplace-related sexual and sex-based harassment. Additionally, anonymity and immediacy are factors that contribute to the prevalence of online workplace-related sexual and sex-based harassment. Reports suggest that anonymity may be a determining factor in whether online input is threatening, abusive or personal.

Additionally, public meeting rooms were discussed, plus a home for non-profit aviation tenants such as EAA and Civil Air Patrol (CAP). The discussion centered on leasing a large office to each of these groups and having them share the same public meeting room. This space would also include a small commercial kitchen for EAA and CAP events.\n\nThe exterior ideas that have emerged from the discussion with various Airport Users and Tenants include utilizing and embracing the airfield side of the building with windows, outdoor seating, an expansion to the playground area, and an outdoor plaza between the current grass and playground and the new hangar. The design theme that has been liked by the staff and the Ad Hoc Committee includes attributes of the Golden Days of aviation (1920s to 1940s). Additionally, the Ad Hoc Committee, staff, and consultants have enjoyed meeting with groups such as Mountain Lion Aviation, EAA Chapter 1073, Civil Air Patrol, Red Truck, Airport Staff, Sierra Aero, and Surf Air to hear their ideas and concepts.","system":"experiment_1e","overall_rating":1,"Is an answer provided?":"","The answer is relevant to the question (regardless of whether the details are correct or not).":"","This answer is useful and helpful to address this question.":"","The answer contains enough information for the question.":"","The answer completely answers the whole question (e.g., it covers every aspect of the question).":"","The answer is missing specific details from the document.":"","The answer is wordy (e.g., unnecessarily long or contains unnecessary words).":"","The answer is easy to read and comprehend.":"","The answer contains inaccurate information (e.g., information that is made up or not true).":"","The answer contains information not found in the document (e.g., information that does not exist in this document).":"","The answer contains irrelevant information (e.g., information that is irrelevant).":"","The answer has been written by an expert.":"","I can trust this answer":""}]},"q3":{"text":"Why do you think the Ad-Hoc committee met with various Airport Users and Tenants?

          "text": "According to source s0, a set of financial transactions taxes applied to the full range of financial assets listed in Table 1 could raise $353.8 billion annually based on 2008 trading volumes. If trading fell by 50 percent in response to the tax, then the tax would raise $176.9 billion. In the context of a 10-year budget horizon, assuming a 50 percent reduction in trading volume, this set of financial transactions taxes would raise more than $1.7 trillion. Source s1 shows that most of the revenue projected from the tax would come from stock transactions. If there were no reductions in trading from the 2008 level, then a tax of 0.5 percent on each stock transaction would raise almost $220 billion a year. If trading fell back by 50 percent, then the tax would still raise almost $110 billion a year on stock trades. The second largest source of revenue is bond trading. Assuming no reduction in trading volume, a tax that was applied at a rate of 0.01 percent for each year to maturity would raise $52.4 billion annually. Assuming a 50 percent reduction in trading volume the tax would raise $26.2 billion. The third largest source of revenue is a tax on trades in swaps. Assuming no reduction in trading volume, a tax applied at the rate of 0.01 percent for each year to maturity would raise $46.3 billion annually. With a 50 percent reduction in trading volume, the revenue would be $23.2 billion. Therefore, the revenue potential from financial trading taxes is significant, with stock transactions contributing the most to this revenue, followed by bond trading and trades in swaps.",

The tax rate structure and sources used for the calculations in Table 1 are outlined in section 2 of source s2. The tax rate applied for commodity futures and forwards is 0.02 percent on each transaction, assuming all forwards and futures were turned over an average of once a year. The tax rate applied for foreign exchange spot transactions is 0.01 percent on each transaction. The tax rate applied for equities is 0.5 percent on a transaction, or 0.25 percent on each side. For swaps, the tax rate is assumed to be 0.01 percent for each year until maturity, with an average life to maturity of 1.5 years and an assumed average turnover of 2 times per year, resulting in a tax rate of 0.015 percent. The tax rate applied for options trading is 0.5 percent of the premium price, the same as the rate on stock trades. The revenue projections in Table 1 show the revenue that can be raised from taxing the trades of each major category of financial assets traded in U.S. markets under alternative assumptions as to the responsiveness of trading volume to the tax.",

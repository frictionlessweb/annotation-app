On the other hand, source 4 suggests that simulations are \"pathetic\" compared to reality. Despite this, companies still believed that Maxis could design realistic simulations, as stated in source 9. It is unclear from the sources how exactly Maxis' simulations impacted the real world, but it seems that they were used by companies to solve complex problems and were seen as a way to make complex simulations understandable to lots of people.\n\nSources:\n[0] For many people though, that nuance was lost, and instead they treated it like Maxis could build accurate simulations of the real world.\n[1] Could a simulation game help people understand how the world works?\n[2] Simulation games were “seductive,” he argued, and there was no clear way to understand how their models differed from reality.\n[3] “That really scares me because I know how pathetic the simulations are, really, compared to reality.\n[4] Simulations let companies solve complex problems.\n[5] “This is a way to take complex simulations and make them understandable to lots of people,” Jeff Braun told the San Francisco Chronicle."},{"id":25,"question":"How did their simulations impact the real world?","answer":"Maxis Business Simulations created several simulation games that were used for educational and training purposes in various industries. For example, Chevron used a game like SimCity to teach employees at their oil refinery in Richmond, California how the refinery process worked [1] [2]. The University of Missouri at Kansas City used SimHealth as part of a certificate training program on health care administration [3]. The Markle Foundation, a non-profit organization that tries to advance the public discourse around government, politics, and health policy, approached Maxis Business Simulations to create a game that would enhance civic dialog around topics like political campaigns and foreign policy. The result was Race for the White House, which was marketed to Congress [4]. However, the impact of these simulations on the real world is debatable. While some praised the effectiveness of the games, others criticized them for containing misinformation and blurring the lines of reality for players [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10].\n\nSources:\n[1] That’s why Chevron wanted Maxis to make them a game like SimCity, to teach the employees at their oil refinery in Richmond, California how it all worked.22\n[2] SimCity helped players build a “mental model” of how a city worked.\n[3] The University of Missouri at Kansas City started using SimHealth as part of a certificate training program on health care administration.47 MetLife’s director of information and computer services called the game “pretty sophisticated,” and she said that everyone at the company who played it had “really enjoyed it and appreciated the educational benefits that can be derived from it.”53\n[4] Despite the shortcomings of SimHealth, the Markle Foundation still loved the game, and they wanted to work with Thinking Tools again to continue exploring their ideas about games and public policy.9 They signed on to co-produce a new series of games called PowerTrip, which were going to “enhance civic dialog” around topics like political campaigns and foreign policy.57 Race for the White House must have been the first of these, as well as the last.\n[5] “SimHealth contains so much misinformation that no one could possibly understand competing proposals and policies, much less evaluate them, on the basis of the program,” Starr said.\n[6] Games like SimCity and SimHealth threatened to blur the lines of reality for players.\n[7] Simulation games were “seductive,” he argued, and there was no clear way to understand how their models differed from reality.\n[8] And so players would never question the math, just accept the game at face value.\n[9] SimHealth, meanwhile, was being marketed to Congress.\n[10] “I made the mistake of bragging that [Race for the White House] would help people to understand that given enough money and a dog that looked like Rin Tin Tin, you could make Rin Tin Tin become the president,” he said.7 The Markle Foundation wanted something that would ask challenging questions about American politics,9 but not like that."}]},"pdf_url":"/api/v1/static/MARCH_20/SimCityLongform.pdf"}

The author uses various techniques such as magnetizing the telekinetic shield with magnets [2], priming the cloak and head separately from the body [3], and using an airbrush to color the cloak [4]. The author also uses a mix of colors to create gradients and highlights, such as using Process Cyan ink and Fluorescent Green for the telekinetic shield [5] [6], and using a mix of Abyssal Blue and Deep Blue for the blue suit [7]. Additionally, the author adds small variations of tone to the skin with the addition of a hint of Dark Sea Blue for the chin area [8]. The author also uses NMM-style gradients on the boots [9], and adds chipped weathering to the armoured boots and shoulder pad by applying Ivory and a dark black-brown tone [10].

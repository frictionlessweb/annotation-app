The game has an untimed, unbounded track editor, which means that players can create tracks of any length and complexity without any time constraints. In 2011, it was proven that the problem of determining whether a track in TrackMania Nations Forever is completable is NP-complete. This was done by reducing the problem to the Boolean satisfiability problem, which is a well-known NP-complete problem. The reduction was done by encoding the track as a Boolean formula and showing that the formula is satisfiable if and only if the track is completable.

It has since had multiple sequels and spin-offs. The game is known for its user-generated content and its emphasis on time trials. (1)\n\nNP-complete is a complexity class in computer science. It refers to problems that are at least as hard as the hardest problems in NP. (2)\n\nThere is no information available that directly answers whether TrackMania is NP-complete or not. However, it is unlikely that TrackMania is NP-complete, as it is a video game and not a computational problem.

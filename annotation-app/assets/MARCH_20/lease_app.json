One option is Education Savings Accounts (ESA), also known as Coverdell Education Savings Accounts, which are attractive college savings vehicles for many families. However, it is important to note that these accounts are not considered \"college savings\" accounts. Another option is custodial accounts, which are considered assets of the student for financial aid purposes.

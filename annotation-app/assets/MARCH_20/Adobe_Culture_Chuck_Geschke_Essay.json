Adobe was founded on a set of core values and beliefs [1]. The raw materials from which Adobe's business is formed are the inventive ideas and creative talent of its employees [2]. Adobe's strong financial balance sheet is not based on assets such as factories, warehouses, storefronts, or mining and mineral rights, but on its people who are skilled in sales, marketing, engineering, and administration [3] [4]. Therefore, the way Adobe behaves and operates its culture directly affects the financial success of its business [5]. Meetings are an important part of Adobe's culture, and they should be convened only when written communication cannot effectively convey the required information or when the opportunity to provide a forum for interactive communication and discussion of ideas is the primary purpose of the meeting [6]. Conveners should consider the hidden costs of face-to-face meetings, including travel expenses, absence of the traveling participants from their local offices, and the negative impact on the quality of home and family life that result from extensive travel [7] [8]. Effective control of spending requires constant vigilance, and each employee has a role to play in controlling Adobe's costs [9] [10]. A successful business organization must operate as a team, not as a loosely knit federation of individuals, and a successful manager must first be a leader who focuses primarily on leading and not directing [11] [12] [13]. The global nature of Adobe's business places an even higher premium on effective horizontal communication throughout the organization [14]. The most important virtue of Adobe's corporate culture is honesty, and the only sure-fire way to be asked to leave this organization is to knowingly fail to tell the truth [15] [16]. To maintain the important components of Adobe's culture, the company must commit to excellent, predictable financial performance [17]. Finally, Chuck Geschke, Adobe's co-founder, instilled a relentless drive for innovation in the company, resulting in some of the most transformative software inventions, including the ubiquitous PDF, Acrobat, Illustrator, Premiere Pro, and Photoshop. As much as his inventions changed the world, it is his focus on people, purpose, and culture that has profoundly impacted each of us at Adobe [18] [19] [20] [21].\n\nSources:\n[1] Adobe was founded on a set of core values and beliefs.\n[2] The raw materials from which our business is formed are the inventive ideas and creative talent of our employees.\n[3] Adobe’s strong financial balance sheet is not based on assets such as factories, warehouses, storefronts, or mining and mineral rights.\n[4] The capital assets of our corporation are our people who are skilled in sales, marketing, engineering, and administration.\n[5] Therefore, the way we behave and operate our culture directly affects the financial success of our business.\n[6] Communication meetings: These meetings should be convened only when written communication cannot effectively convey the required information or when the opportunity to provide a forum for interactive communication and discussion of ideas is the primary purpose of the meeting.\n[7] Clearly, travel expenses for face-to-face meetings contribute significantly to our expense budget.\n[8] But there are other hidden costs, including absence of the traveling participants from their local offices as well as the negative impact on the quality of home and family life that result from extensive travel.\n[9] Effective control of spending requires constant vigilance.\n[10] Failure to control expenses has a direct impact on our earnings, growth, stock price, and profit sharing.\n[11] A successful business organization must operate as a team, not as a loosely knit federation of individuals.\n[12] A successful manager must first be a leader.\n[13] A manager should focus primarily on leading and not directing.\n[14] The global nature of our business places an even higher premium on effective horizontal communication throughout the organization.\n[15] The most important virtue of Adobe’s corporate culture is honesty.\n[16] The only sure-fire way to be asked to leave this organization is to knowingly fail to tell the truth.\n[17] To maintain the important components of our culture, we must commit to excellent, predictable financial performance.\n[18] Chuck instilled a relentless drive for innovation in the company, resulting in some of the most transformative software inventions, including the ubiquitous PDF, Acrobat, Illustrator, Premiere Pro and Photoshop.\n[19] Their first product was Adobe PostScript, a pivotal technology that sparked the desktop publishing revolution.\n[20] Chuck instilled a relentless drive for innovation in the company, resulting in some of the most transformative software inventions, including the ubiquitous PDF, Acrobat, Illustrator, Premiere Pro and Photoshop.\n[21] As much as his inventions changed the world, it is his focus on people, purpose and culture that has profoundly impacted each of us at Adobe."},{"id":12,"text":"The most important virtue of Adobe's corporate culture is honesty, as stated in source 0.\n\nSources:","system":"gpt_retrieval"},{"id":14,"text":"According to source s0, the most important virtue of Adobe's corporate culture is honesty.\n\nSources:"},{"id":17,"text":"Chuck Geschke was a co-founder of Adobe who served as the co-chairman and co-CEO for 18 years before retiring in 2000.

that he or she must do it him or herself, or it will never fully be accomplished.\n[22] A truly educated individual continues learning well beyond the hours and years spent in the classroom.\n[23] He or she is motivated from within by a natural curiosity and love of knowledge.\n[24] Dr. Montessori felt that the goal of early childhood education shouldn’t be to fill a child with facts from a pre-selected, rigid course of study, but rather to simply cultivate the natural desire to learn.\n[25] In the Montessori classroom, this is achieved in two ways: first by allowing the child to experience the\n[26] excitement that comes with learning by his or her own choice, and second to help perfect the natural tools needed for lifelong exploration and learning.\n[27] Parents should understand that a Montessori School is not a typical pre-k or “play school” setting, as the child is not being prepared for a traditional kindergarten.\n[28] Rather Montessori is a multi-year program designed to take advantage of the natural sensitive periods that occur between the ages of 3 and 6.\n[29] A child who starts his or her education at a Montessori school has the advantage of acquiring basic reading and arithmetic skills naturally, without the boredom or discouragement.\n[30] How the Children Learn\n[31] The use of the Montessori materials is based on the young child's unique aptitude for learning, which Dr. Montessori identified as the \"absorbent mind.\"\n[32] IN her writings, she frequently compared the young mind to a sponge, because it absorbs information from the environment.\n[33] Acquiring information without conscious, tedious effort, makes learning a natural and delightful activity for the young child who employs all his senses to investigate his surroundings.\n[34] Since the child retains this ability to learn by absorption until he is almost seven years old, Dr. Montessori reasoned that childhood experience would be enhanced by a classroom in which the child handles materials that\n[35] demonstrate basic educational information.\n[36] Over sixty years of experience has proven her theory.\n[37] A young child can learn to read, write and calculate in the same natural way that he learns to walk and talk.\n[38] Another observation of Dr. Montessori's which has been reinforced by modern research is the importance of the sensitive periods for early learning.\n[39] These are periods of intense fascination for learning in particular characteristic or skill, such as going up and down steps, putting things in order, counting or reading.\n[40] It is easier for the child to learn a particular skill during the corresponding sensitive period than at any other time in his life.\n[41] The Montessori classroom takes advantage of these periods by\n[42] allowing the child freedom to select individual activities which correspond to natural periods of interest and readiness.\n[43] A child can usually enter a Montessori classroom between the ages of 2 and 6 years, depending on when he or she is ready and comfortable in a classroom situation.\n[44] He or she will begin with the simplest exercises, based on activities that all children enjoy.\n[45] The equipment the child uses at 3 and 4 will help develop the concentration, coordination, and work habits necessary for more learning and exploration.\n[46] Academic enrichment is provided at the child's level of interest.\n[47] With the use of Montessori materials, students receive instruction in reading, spelling, geography, social studies, grammar, science, botany, math, and a variety of elective subjects."},{"id":12,"text":"If a child or staff member experiences diarrhea, they may return to school 24 hours after their last episode of diarrhea, unless the diarrhea is caused by an illness that requires them to stay home longer.

With the use of Montessori materials, students receive instruction in a variety of subjects, including reading, spelling, geography, social studies, grammar, science, botany, math, and a variety of elective subjects [6]. In a Montessori classroom, difficult concepts are presented in a concrete form, such as fractions or verbs, to make them tangible and memorable for the child [7] [8] [9]. The habits and skills that a child develops in a Montessori classroom are good for a lifetime, whether a student continues his or her education in another Montessori program [10].\n\nSources:\n[1] A child can usually enter a Montessori classroom between the ages of 2 and 6 years, depending on when he or she is ready and comfortable in a classroom situation.\n[2] To best take advantage of this natural window for learning, and set the child on the course for life-long success, the Montessori philosophy encourages children to start school before the age of 4, and, ideally, as early as 3.\n[3] Dr. Montessori felt that the goal of early childhood education shouldn’t be to fill a child with facts from a pre-selected, rigid course of study, but rather to simply cultivate the natural desire to learn.\n[4] The use of the Montessori materials is based on the young child's unique aptitude for learning, which Dr. Montessori identified as the \"absorbent mind.\"\n[5] allowing the child freedom to select individual activities which correspond to natural periods of interest and readiness.\n[6] With the use of Montessori materials, students receive instruction in reading, spelling, geography, social studies, grammar, science, botany, math, and a variety of elective subjects.\n[7] Our answer is, even at that age youngsters can joyfully absorb many difficult concepts if they meet them in a concrete form.\n[8] For example, in a Montessori classroom, a unit of fraction is not simply a number on paper.\n[9] The materials that make these concepts tangible ultimately serve as memory touchstones when the child encounters the terms in the future.\n[10] The habits and skills that a child develops in a Montessori classroom are good for a lifetime, whether a student continues his or her education in another Montessori program."}]}}

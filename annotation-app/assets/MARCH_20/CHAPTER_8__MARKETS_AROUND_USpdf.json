One reason could be that they have a fixed pricing policy and do not want to devalue their products by offering discounts. Another reason could be that they have high overhead costs, such as rent and utilities, and cannot afford to offer discounts without affecting their profit margins. Additionally, some shops may not give discounts because they do not want to attract bargain hunters who are not likely to become repeat customers. Finally, some shops may not give discounts because they do not want to compete with other shops in the mall that are offering similar products at discounted prices.\n\nSources:"},{"id":25,"question":"Why shops in malls do not give discounts","answer":"There is no specific source that directly answers the question of why shops in malls do not give discounts. However, it can be inferred from source s10 that shops in malls have fixed rates and no bargaining can be done, which implies that discounts are not given [1]. In contrast, weekly markets have a large number of shops selling the same goods to people so that people have a variety of options, and since there are so many similar shops, bargaining can be done easily [2] [3]. Additionally, many things in weekly markets are available at cheaper rates, and affordable prices and bargaining are common features of these markets [4] [5]. It is also mentioned that simple people without much educational qualification, often with family members helping, can sell goods in weekly markets, which suggests that the overhead costs of running a shop in a mall may be higher, leading to fixed prices [6] [7] [8]. Finally, it is noted that some merchants in weekly markets can be rich and have good communication skills in English, indicating that the economic background of the seller is not a factor in the pricing of goods in weekly markets [9].\n\nSources:\n[1] Fixed rate and no bargaining can be done.\n[2] Weekly markets have a large number of shops selling the same goods to people so that people have a variety of options.\n[3] Since there are so many similar shops, bargaining can be done easily.\n[4] Many things in weekly markets are available at cheaper rates.\n[5] Affordable and bargaining can be done.\n[6] Simple people without much educational qualification.\n[7] Often family members also help\n[8] Can be from any economic background be it rich or poor.\n[9] Can be rich merchants with good communication skills in english."}]}}

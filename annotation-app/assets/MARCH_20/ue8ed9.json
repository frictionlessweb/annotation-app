Networks can be wired or wireless and can be used for various purposes such as sharing files, printers, and internet access. In a network, each device has a unique identifier called an IP address, which is used to send and receive data. Devices in a network can be connected through switches, routers, and other networking equipment. When a device wants to communicate with another device on the network, it sends a message to the recipient's IP address. The message is then routed through the network until it reaches its destination. This process is known as packet switching. Networks can be private or public, and security measures such as firewalls and encryption can be used to protect sensitive data.\n\nSources:","system":"gpt_retrieval"},{"id":9,"text":"A network is a collection of computers that are connected to each other with the help of cables or satellite to share information and communicate around the world [1]. Networks can be designed using different architectures, such as a LAN, which connects a group of computers in a small geographical area [2], or a WAN, which covers a relatively large region such as cities, towns [3]. The Internet is a network that spans large localities and connects countries together [4]. The Internet was originally designed for academic research, but private companies built their own networks, which were later interconnected along with ARPANET and NSFnet to form the Internet [5] [6]. Each computer connected to the Internet has software called TCP/IP, which is responsible for receiving, sending, and checking packets [7] [8]. The Internet is characterized by how data is transferred from one computer to another [9]. When a user sends a request to view a webpage, the web browser acts as an interface between the user and the World Wide Web, allowing the user to view the required webpage on their computer [10] [11]. A web server is a computer that stores websites and their related files for viewing on the Internet [12]. A URL refers to an address on the internet, which has two main components: the protocol identifier and the resource name separated by a colon and two forward slashes [13] [14]. The first part of a URL tells you the type of resource or method of access at that address, while the second part is typically the address of the computer where the data or service is located [15] [16]. A domain name always has two or more parts separated by dots and typically consists of some form of an organization's name and a three-letter or more suffix [17]. The Internet is made up of millions of sites, and all browsers perform different functions [18].\n\nSources:\n[1] A network is a collection of computers that are connected to each other with the help of cables or satellite to share information and communicate around the world.\n[2] A network that connects a group of computers in a small geographical area.\n[3] It covers relatively large region such as cities, towns.\n[4] It spans large locality and connects countries together.\n[5] NSFnet allowed only the academic research on its network and not any kind of private business on it.\n[6] So many private companies built their own networks, which was later interconnected along with ARPANET and NSFnet to form Internet.\n[7] Each computer connected to the Internet has software called TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) which is responsible for receiving, sending and checking packets.\n[8] TCP/IP is the 'glue' of the Internet.\n[9] The thing that characterizes the Internet is how data transferred from one computer to another.\n[10] Web Browser is the software used to view Web sites.\n[11] It acts as an interface between the user and World Wide Web.\n[12] A web server is a computer that stores websites and their related files for viewing on the Internet\n[13] A URL has two main components:\n[14] The protocol identifier and the resource name are separated by a colon and two forward slashes.\n[15] The first part of a URL (before the two slashes) tells you the type of resource or method of access at that address.\n[16] The second part is typically the address of the computer where the data or service is located.\n[17] A domain name always has two or more parts separated by dots and typically consists of some form of an organization's name and a three letter or more suffix.\n[18] There are millions of sites in the internet."},{"id":12,"text":"Cloud computing has a wide range of applications, including data storage, software development, and web hosting.

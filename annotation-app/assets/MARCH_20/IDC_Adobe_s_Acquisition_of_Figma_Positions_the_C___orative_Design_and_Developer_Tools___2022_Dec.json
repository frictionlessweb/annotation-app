Firstly, it provides Adobe with the opportunity to champion the importance of DesignOps in the development process. Secondly, it enhances Adobe's product portfolio and increases its top-line growth. Thirdly, it positions Adobe to lead in the development of cutting-edge, collaborative experiences for developers, expanding its total addressable market of products and services. Fourthly, it allows Adobe to leverage Figma's advanced collaboration and sharing functionality to enhance its portfolio of design tools. Fifthly, it expands Adobe's ability to actively participate in contemporary software development, transforming it from a vendor that specializes in design to one that has the potential to provide leadership in collaborative development practices that are based in the cloud. Finally, the acquisition has the potential to disruptively transform contemporary software development practices in ways that have the potential to monetize Figma. It is important to note that Figma will operate independently of Adobe as a separate business for the time being.

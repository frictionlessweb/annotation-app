Additionally, one should finalize all frameworks for PM design, strategy, analytical, and technical interviews and practice 1-2 questions in detail per day (source 8). Mock interviews with calibrated PMs are also recommended (source 2), and peer-interviews can be useful to see different approaches people take (source 3). Sample PM questions can be found online (source 4), but it is important to note that a good PM will always think about drawbacks and loopholes without prompting from interviewers (source 5).

Additionally, the Stratechery blog is a great resource for tech trends and strategy [5]. For strategy type questions, it is useful to consider the company's goals, market opportunity, and success metrics [6] [7] [8]. It is also important to have knowledge of data structures such as arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, hash tables, stacks, and queues [9], as well as database designs and web vulnerabilities [10] [11]. For product design, steps to designing product features, user segmentation/persona, and customer research methodology are important [12] [13] [14]. Analytical skills are also important, including knowledge of metrics and data collection, as well as how to analyze issues and trends [15] [16]. It is also important to have a framework for reviewing and finalizing strategies, such as tradeoffs, new market entry, CEO-level issues and strategy, and pricing [17]. To build a framework, it is recommended to start with simplified frameworks and modify and add notes as you practice [18]. It is also important to clarify the market, timing, and constraints, and to assume goals and why they matter for the company [19] [20]. Additionally, it is useful to consider the value chain and competitors to decide where to play [21]. Paying attention to user trends and current events is also a plus [22]. To prepare, it is recommended to practice 70-100 questions on your own, 2-3 times each, and to do mock interviews with calibrated PMs [23] [24] [25]. It is also important to be confident, user-centric, and always evaluate your ideas and strategies [26] [27] [28].

It is also helpful to read articles related to the company you are interviewing for and take notes (source 7). Additionally, one should finalize all frameworks for PM design, strategy, analytical, and technical interviews and practice 1-2 questions in detail per day (source 8). Mock interviews with calibrated PMs are also recommended (source 2), and peer-interviews can be useful to see different approaches people take (source 3). Sample PM questions can be found online (source 4), but it is important to note that a good PM will always think about drawbacks and loopholes without prompting from interviewers (source 5).

Additionally, the Stratechery blog is a great resource for tech trends and strategy [5]. For strategy type questions, it is useful to consider the company's goals, market opportunity, and success metrics [6] [7] [8]. It is also important to have knowledge of data structures such as arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, hash tables, stacks, and queues [9], as well as database designs and web vulnerabilities [10] [11]. For product design, steps to designing product features, user segmentation/persona, and customer research methodology are important [12] [13] [14]. Analytical skills are also important, including knowledge of metrics and data collection, as well as how to analyze issues and trends [15] [16]. It is also important to have a framework for reviewing and finalizing strategies, such as tradeoffs, new market entry, CEO-level issues and strategy, and pricing [17]. To build a framework, it is recommended to start with simplified frameworks and modify and add notes as you practice [18]. It is also important to clarify the market, timing, and constraints, and to assume goals and why they matter for the company [19] [20]. Additionally, it is useful to consider the value chain and competitors to decide where to play [21]. Paying attention to user trends and current events is also a plus [22]. To prepare, it is recommended to practice 70-100 questions on your own, 2-3 times each, and to do mock interviews with calibrated PMs [23] [24] [25]. It is also important to be confident, user-centric, and always evaluate your ideas and strategies [26] [27] [28].

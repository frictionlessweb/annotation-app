However, a non-U.S. person is generally not allowed to use portability, unless specifically provided for in a treaty. In order to avoid this, a tool called the Qualified Domestic Trust (QDOT) can be employed. Additionally, a non-U.S. spouse may decide to apply for U.S. citizenship in order to qualify for the unlimited marital deduction, but careful evaluation of this option is necessary. Non-U.S. persons may be subject to U.S. estate and gift taxes if they are living in the U.S. at the time of their death or at the time of making a gift, and may also be subject to income tax if they are a permanent resident or meet the IRS's criteria under the \"substantial presence test\". The U.S. taxes the entire worldwide assets of its residents and citizens (U.S. persons) for estate and gift tax purposes. A non-U.S. person may be subject to U.S. estate tax if their property located in the U.S. is valued at $60,000 or more, but if they are a citizen of a country that has an estate tax treaty with the United States, the estate tax exemption may be higher. Finally, any distributions made from the QDOT to the non-U.S. spouse, except for income and hardship purposes, will be subject to U.S. estate tax, and the remaining assets in the trust will be subject to the U.S. estate tax at the time of the non-U.S. spouse's passing.","overall_rating":1,"Does this answer provide enough information for the question?":"","Does this answer provide inaccurate information?":"","Does this answer provide information not found in the document?":"","Does this answer completely answer the whole question?":"","Is it easy to read this answer?":"","Is this answer relevant to the question?":"","Do you feel the answer is wordy?":"","Do you believe or trust this answer?":"","Do you need more details?":"","Are there any new ideas or concepts in this answer that make you somewhat surprised?":"","Is this answer useful or helpful to address the question?":"","Do you think this answer has been written by an expert?":""},{"text":"This Advisory discusses the estate tax benefits for those individuals who are not citizens of the United States and/or spouses of United States citizens who are not citizens of the United States. For estate and gift tax purposes, the U.S. taxes the entire worldwide assets of its residents and citizens (U.S. persons). A person may be considered a U.S. resident for estate and gift tax purposes if he or she is living in the U.S. at the time of his or her death or at the time of making a gift. This may be the case even if that person is not officially a U.S. resident or citizen. U.S. persons are entitled to the maximum estate tax exemption, which currently is $5,430,000 for the year 2015 increasing to $5,450,000 in 2016 (this figure increases each year based on the rate of inflation). In contrast, non-U.S. persons only receive a $13,000 unified transfer tax credit that may be used to offset both lifetime gift tax liabilities and the estate tax liability and must file a U.S. estate tax return if their property located in the U.S. is valued at $60,000 or more. If the non-U.S. person is a citizen of a country that has an estate tax treaty with United States, then it is possible that the estate tax exemption may be higher. Currently, the U.S. has estate and gift tax treaties with the following countries: Australia, Austria, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.","overall_rating":1,"Does this answer provide enough information for the question?":"","Does this answer provide inaccurate information?":"","Does this answer provide information not found in the document?":"","Does this answer completely answer the whole question?":"","Is it easy to read this answer?":"","Is this answer relevant to the question?":"","Do you feel the answer is wordy?":"","Do you believe or trust this answer?":"","Do you need more details?":"","Are there any new ideas or concepts in this answer that make you somewhat surprised?":"","Is this answer useful or helpful to address the question?":"","Do you think this answer has been written by an expert?":""},{"text":"Non-U.S. citizens and spouses of U.S. citizens who are not citizens of the United States have limited estate tax benefits compared to U.S. citizens.

If a U.S. spouse and a non-U.S. spouse hold title to property as joint tenants with right of survivorship, the “contribution rule” will be applied to determine the value of the asset that will be included in the gross estate of the U.S. spouse. Under the contribution rule, the entire value of the jointly held property may be included in the U.S. spouse’s gross estate except for any portion that can be shown to have been contributed by the non-U.S. spouse or on behalf of the non-U.S. spouse as a gift by a third party bequest, devise or inheritance.

{"ANSWER_QUALITY":{"q1":{"text":"What are the challenges in collaboration between traditional insurers and novel startups like InsureTech?","index":0,"answers":[{"text":"Collaboration between traditional insurers and InsurTech startups can be challenging due to significant differences in culture, workforce, agility, and technology. Some traditional insurers are more than 300 years old, whereas many InsurTechs are less than 300 days old. Insurers need to embrace innovation as part of business as usual. Simply participating in third-party incubators or investing in a few startups will not be enough. Having the right corporate culture, innovation strategy, and funding are all important. Additionally, startups with little or no prior knowledge of the insurance industry struggle to quickly demonstrate their value proposition and make tangible impacts.","system":"experiment_1e","overall_rating":1,"Is an answer provided?":"","The answer is relevant to the question (regardless of whether the details are correct or not).":"","This answer is useful and helpful to address this question.":"","The answer contains enough information for the question.":"","The answer completely answers the whole question (e.g., it covers every aspect of the question).":"","The answer is missing specific details from the document.":"","The answer is wordy (e.g., unnecessarily long or contains unnecessary words).":"","The answer is easy to read and comprehend.":"","The answer contains inaccurate information (e.g., information that is made up or not true).":"","The answer contains information not found in the document (e.g., information that does not exist in this document).":"","The answer contains irrelevant information (e.g., information that is irrelevant).":"","The answer has been written by an expert.":"","I can trust this answer":""}]},"q2":{"text":"How young startups and a mature industry can bring out the best in one another? Explain with the example of insurance industry.","index":0,"answers":[{"text":"The insurance industry is a mature industry that has been around for centuries, while InsurTech startups are relatively new and have been around for only a few years. The biggest challenge for startups entering or already operating in this area is a lack of awareness and understanding of the industry. Startups with little or no prior knowledge of the insurance industry struggle to quickly demonstrate their value proposition and make tangible impacts. \n\nHowever, collaboration between old and new is not always straightforward. Some traditional insurers are more than 300 years old, whereas many InsurTechs are less than 300 days old. This can lead to significant challenges and differences surrounding culture, workforce, agility, and technology. \n\nClever startups will support insurers on their transformation journeys by taking conscious decisions over speed of implementation and engagement. Partnerships between insurers, startups, and other collaborators should be built on a win-win basis. Identifying additional ‘wins’ greatly improves the chances of success. The startup might greatly benefit from access to a subset of the insurer’s customer base to test out its propositions and capabilities, for instance. Equally, the insurer will most likely find additional accelerators for enhancing customer value, propositions, and operations.\n\nThe insurance partners gained valuable insights into the new technologies coming into the market, and were also able to develop and enhance their innovation agendas. Accenture’s Technology Vision for Insurance 2016 revealed that 44 percent of insurers across the world intend to pursue digital initiatives with startups from the insurance industry over the next two years. \n\nIn conclusion, startups and mature industries can bring out the best in one another by collaborating and building partnerships on a win-win basis. Startups can bring new technologies and innovative ideas to the table, while mature industries can provide valuable insights and access to a large customer base. By working together, both parties can benefit and ultimately enhance customer value, propositions, and operations.","system":"experiment_1e","overall_rating":1,"Is an answer provided?":"","The answer is relevant to the question (regardless of whether the details are correct or not).":"","This answer is useful and helpful to address this question.":"","The answer contains enough information for the question.":"","The answer completely answers the whole question (e.g., it covers every aspect of the question).":"","The answer is missing specific details from the document.":"","The answer is wordy (e.g., unnecessarily long or contains unnecessary words).":"","The answer is easy to read and comprehend.":"","The answer contains inaccurate information (e.g., information that is made up or not true).":"","The answer contains information not found in the document (e.g., information that does not exist in this document).":"","The answer contains irrelevant information (e.g., information that is irrelevant).":"","The answer has been written by an expert.":"","I can trust this answer":""}]},"q3":{"text":"What is the difference in the level of progress exhibited by Insurtech and other FinTech companies?","index":0,"answers":[{"text":"There are signs that the broader FinTech industry may have reached a new level of maturity, with investment in some regions beginning to cool off.

InsurTech involves agile business approaches, coupled with a spirit of ‘try and see’ rather than ‘learn and do’.

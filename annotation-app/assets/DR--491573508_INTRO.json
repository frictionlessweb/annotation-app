          "text": "InsurTechs face several challenges when trying to collaborate with traditional insurers. One of the biggest challenges is the cultural differences between the two. Traditional insurers have been around for hundreds of years and have a more risk-averse culture, while InsurTechs are more agile and have a \"try and see\" approach. Another challenge is the differences in technology and workforce. InsurTechs have cutting-edge technologies, while many insurers still use legacy platforms that are not compatible with InsurTechs' technologies. InsurTechs also need to understand the insurance industry deeply to demonstrate their value proposition and make tangible impacts quickly. Finally, InsurTechs need to be patient and flexible in their partnering approach and recognize that traditional insurers will need to embark on their own cultural and technological journeys.",

Additionally, InsurTech culture does not truly understand the insurance culture, and startups can become frustrated by the sheer size of insurance organizations and their risk-adverse cultures . However, there is a growing recognition among insurers that InsurTech ultimately represents more of an opportunity than a threat, and that they should seek to collaborate more closely with this latest breed of technology-fueled startups . Many insurers are already leveraging design thinking and other techniques to solve business problems in-house , and partnerships between insurers, startups, and other collaborators should be built on a win-win basis .",

          "text": "Based on the research presented in the document, there is evidence to suggest that decreasing sea ice in the Arctic could lead to increased amplification of the jet stream off the west coast of the United States. The study found that there is a link between an increasing ridge and decreasing sea ice, which could be important for forecasting purposes, especially long term when issuing seasonal forecasts. The research suggests that years like the amplification seen in 2013 will become more frequent, and that jet stream amplification is not just confined to the colder seasons. However, it is unclear how much more the wave pattern will be affected when the Arctic becomes ice-free frequently during the summer occurring sometime in the next 2 to 4 decades.",

The increased ridging off of the West Coast of the United States not only affects the climate regions adjacent to that location but also has downstream impacts on precipitation. The teleconnections of recent trends in height anomalies across the eastern Pacific Ocean with regional precipitation are examined, and the results suggest that this ridge is also increasing at a confidence level of 99% and that, coupled with the ridge off the West Coast, is further strengthening the teleconnections to rainfall in the Upper Midwest.",

The inspectors identified aspects of practice which would benefit from further development, which had already been recognized by the leadership team and are addressed in the school’s development plan . The staff spoken to during this inspection felt well supported and expressed confidence in the ability of the new headteacher and deputy headteachers to make continuous improvements . The young people who spoke to inspectors during this inspection consistently reported that they feel safe at the school . A particular strength of the school is the process for monitoring young people’s progress, in terms of their personal and social development and their academic achievement .",

A restorative approach is taken to resolving unacceptable behavior. Parents are kept informed of young people's progress and are consulted when young people are experiencing difficulties with any aspect of life at the school.

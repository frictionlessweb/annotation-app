          "text": "Defining keywords is one of the most important elements in a search engine marketing strategy as it helps to target the audience that is likely to use those keywords when searching on search engines like Google, Yahoo!, and Bing. In a Pay-Per-Click system, advertisers choose keywords that act as triggers for displaying their ads, and each keyword is assigned a cost based on its popularity. Successful search engine marketing requires an understanding of how systems like Google AdWords and Yahoo! Search Marketing work, and the success of the campaign is limited by the advertiser's knowledge and time commitment. Once the keywords have been chosen, a daily limit is set to the amount of money the advertiser is willing to spend on people clicking sponsored links to their website. Ultimately, the goal of a search engine marketing campaign is to get more sales for the business, and defining the right keywords is crucial to achieving that goal.",

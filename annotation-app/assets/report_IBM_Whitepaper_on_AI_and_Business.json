Implementing AI should be a carefully thought out process, and companies should evaluate how AI can help solve their problems and where they are in terms of capabilities before properly implementing AI to address the problems they want to solve or the opportunities they want to take. Companies should also avoid the pitfall of wanting to implement machine learning right off the bat, as they need to acquire or outsource their own data science talent and look at their current IT infrastructure.",

          "text": "There are several pitfalls to avoid when implementing an AI strategy in a company. One of the biggest pitfalls is a culture that’s not committed to making data-driven decisions. Another pitfall is the belief that AI is a magical box that will quickly solve all the problems a company has. It is also important to avoid the misconception that high-profile research projects can be applied directly to any business situation. Additionally, it is crucial to take into account transparency and how much data, capabilities, and time the company has, as some algorithms take a long time to run. The \"black box\" problem is another pitfall to avoid, as it is almost impossible to determine why the system came to a certain conclusion. It is important to align the right people before starting an AI project, as implementing AI through the organization can be a long process, and without support of the right people, there’s a higher probability that the project will fail. Many companies want to implement machine learning right off the bat, but it is important to start small and scale quickly. It is also crucial to evaluate the capabilities the company currently has in-house before starting an AI project and then define the cost of acquiring the capabilities needed to close any gaps. Data availability is another pitfall to avoid, as it depends on the company and how it stores data. Finally, there is no one magic algorithm that can solve all the company's problems, so it is important to focus on the problems the company has and how AI can help solve them..",

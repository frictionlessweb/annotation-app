To accomplish this, install a full set of SRP system files on the local drive on each user's workstation, confirm that the sharing option for Microsoft Access is set to \"Shared\" on each PC, and confirm that all users are connected to the network and have full read/write permission to access the server and shared directories. When a project is opened, the project that was last open is re-attached automatically. The SRP system is designed to allow multiple people on the team to input, edit and run reports, and do this in any order. The system does not impose a step by step linear process to follow, so that you can be as flexible and responsive as the project demands.","system":"experiment_1e","overall_rating":1,"Is an answer provided?":"","The answer is relevant to the question (regardless of whether the details are correct or not).":"","This answer is useful and helpful to address this question.":"","The answer contains enough information for the question.":"","The answer completely answers the whole question (e.g., it covers every aspect of the question).":"","The answer is missing specific details from the document.":"","The answer is wordy (e.g., unnecessarily long or contains unnecessary words).":"","The answer is easy to read and comprehend.":"","The answer contains inaccurate information (e.g., information that is made up or not true).":"","The answer contains information not found in the document (e.g., information that does not exist in this document).":"","The answer contains irrelevant information (e.g., information that is irrelevant).":"","The answer has been written by an expert.":"","I can trust this answer":""}]},"q4":{"text":"What is Rapid Applications Development (RAD)?","index":0,"answers":[{"text":"Rapid Applications Development (RAD) is a software development methodology that emphasizes rapid prototyping and iterative development.

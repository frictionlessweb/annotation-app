The projects include: \n- A proposal seeking funding to continue the development of a multi-species HCP, associated NEPA document, and on-going studies and investigations to inform forest management practices and bat conservation.\n- A project that aims to enhance landscape-scale connectivity between large blocks of protected lands at mid elevation, achieving state and federal goals for climate adaptation and resilience.\n- A project that will develop approaches to conserve covered species while allowing sustainable forest management practices, which in-turn, will allow public and private landowners to meet economic, ecological and social goals.\n- A project that seeks funding to acquire habitat to support the recovery of southern California vernal pool species, which will also protect a critical seed resource for future prairie restoration efforts.\n- A project that will result in a better understanding of the HHB’s status and distribution in commercial forest stands, reduce and mitigate impacts from biomass and timber harvest operations, and conserve the HHB while allowing sustainable forest management practices, which will allow public and private landowners to meet economic, ecological, and social goals.\n- A project that aims to provide a high conservation benefit to listed karst invertebrates and the Georgetown salamander, resulting in a draft HCP and associated NEPA compliance documents.\n- A project that aims to bring certainty to endangered species management and irrigated agriculture in the Upper Deschutes Basin, and will serve as a model for coordinated and cooperative use of water resources throughout the irrigated western United States.\n\nTherefore, the purpose of the project mentioned in the text depends on which project is being referred to.",

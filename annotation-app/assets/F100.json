          "text": "A \"wide\" or \"leg-side wide\" counts as part of the over and incurs a 2 run penalty unless it is the 4th, 8th, 12th or 16th over. If a deliberate no ball or wide is bowled at any stage of the game, normal penalties are awarded to the batting side plus an extra ball to be bowled. A no ball counts as part of the over and incurs a penalty of two runs which is added to the batting. A leg side wide will be called when the ball after bouncing on the pitch in front of the batting crease, or on the full without bouncing passes outside the intersection of the batting crease and the line marked 30 cm from the striker's leg stump without being touched by his/her person or equipment. If a no ball, leg side or wide is bowled in the last delivery of any innings, the Umpire shall award 2 runs to the batsman and have the ball re-bowled. If by having the ball re-bowled it should be to the batsman's disadvantage the batsman may decline to receive the extra ball. Persistent bowling of a wide or no ball as last ball of innings will be concluded at Umpires discretion in \"the spirit of the game\", taking into account bowler's ability to deliver a good ball. All Wide's, Legside's and No balls bowled in the final over of each batting partnerships will be rebowled. Therefore, wide balls are penalized with a 2 run penalty, except in the 4th, 8th, 12th, or 16th over, and they are rebowled in the final over of each batting partnership.",

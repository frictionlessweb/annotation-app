This heterogeneity can be represented by a distribution of agents or wealth across a fixed or changing set of strategies. In agent-based financial markets, dynamic heterogeneity is critical, and traders are defined by heterogeneous memory lengths, preferences, and evaluation strategies. The presence of investor heterogeneity can lead to increased volatility in financial markets, and it is an important factor to consider in modeling and understanding market dynamics.","system":"experiment_1e","overall_rating":1,"confidence_rating":1,"inaccurate_text":"","external_text":"","Does any part of the answer say 'I don’t know' or that there’s 'insufficient context' to provide an answer?":"","The answer is relevant to the question (regardless of whether the details are correct or not).":"","The answer contains inaccurate information (e.g., information that is made up or not true).":"","The answer contains information not found in the document (e.g., information that does not exist in this document).":"","The answer contains irrelevant information (e.g., information that is irrelevant).":"","This answer is useful and helpful to address this question.":"","The answer contains enough information for the question.":"","The answer completely answers the whole question (e.g., it covers every aspect of the question).":"","The answer is missing specific details from the document.":"","The answer is wordy (e.g., unnecessarily long or contains unnecessary words).":"","The answer is easy to read and comprehend.":"","The answer has been written by an expert.":"","I can trust this answer":""}]},"q3":{"text":"What was the revolution witnessed by finance in the mid to later part of the 20th century?","index":0,"answers":[{"text":"Finance witnessed a revolution in the mid to later part of the 20th century with the advent of the efficient markets hypothesis, the capital asset pricing model, and the Black/Scholes options pricing formula which put the field on a new, solid scientific foundation.","system":"experiment_1e","overall_rating":1,"confidence_rating":1,"inaccurate_text":"","external_text":"","Does any part of the answer say 'I don’t know' or that there’s 'insufficient context' to provide an answer?":"","The answer is relevant to the question (regardless of whether the details are correct or not).":"","The answer contains inaccurate information (e.g., information that is made up or not true).":"","The answer contains information not found in the document (e.g., information that does not exist in this document).":"","The answer contains irrelevant information (e.g., information that is irrelevant).":"","This answer is useful and helpful to address this question.":"","The answer contains enough information for the question.":"","The answer completely answers the whole question (e.g., it covers every aspect of the question).":"","The answer is missing specific details from the document.":"","The answer is wordy (e.g., unnecessarily long or contains unnecessary words).":"","The answer is easy to read and comprehend.":"","The answer has been written by an expert.":"","I can trust this answer":""}]},"q4":{"text":"Why do you think financial markets are viewed as interacting groups of learning and boundedly-rational agents?","index":0,"answers":[{"text":"Financial markets are viewed as interacting groups of learning and boundedly-rational agents because it is believed that agents in financial markets may differ in many ways, not just in their information, but in their ability to process information, their attitudes toward risk, and in many other dimensions.

The fitness of a strategy is determined by its ex post utility, which can be calculated using equation (17):\n\n(17)\n\nwhere dt is the only state variable, a and b are parameters that can be derived from the underlying parameters of the model, and pi is the price of the risky asset in period i.\n\n- Lettau's mutation operator involves flipping each bit according to a fixed probability. The mutation rate is slowly decayed over time, so that eventually mutation probabilities go to zero. This is a form of cooling down the learning rates as time progresses.\n\nOverall, Lettau's framework involves using a genetic algorithm to learn the optimal portfolio strategy in a financial market, with agents' policy functions simplified to the optimal linear functional form.

It can also open BAM files, which are binary versions of SAM files. When opening a file, FastQC will try to guess the file format from the name of the input file.

In this mode, the program will merge the files in a sample group and present a single report for each sample. The Casava mode of the program will exclude flagged sequences from the report. FastQC supports both regular FastQ and Casava FastQ files, as well as other file formats such as SAM and BAM. The main difference between the two formats is the way the data is organized and presented to the program.","system":"experiment_1e","overall_rating":1,"Is an answer provided?":"","The answer is relevant to the question (regardless of whether the details are correct or not).":"","This answer is useful and helpful to address this question.":"","The answer contains enough information for the question.":"","The answer completely answers the whole question (e.g., it covers every aspect of the question).":"","The answer is missing specific details from the document.":"","The answer is wordy (e.g., unnecessarily long or contains unnecessary words).":"","The answer is easy to read and comprehend.":"","The answer contains inaccurate information (e.g., information that is made up or not true).":"","The answer contains information not found in the document (e.g., information that does not exist in this document).":"","The answer contains irrelevant information (e.g., information that is irrelevant).":"","The answer has been written by an expert.":"","I can trust this answer":""}]},"q5":{"text":"How is analysis in FastQC better than other QCs?","index":0,"answers":[{"text":"FastQC aims to provide a QC report which can spot problems which originate either in the sequencer or in the starting library material. Most sequencers will generate a QC report as part of their analysis pipeline, but this is usually only focused on identifying problems which were generated by the sequencer itself. Additionally, FastQC can be run in a non-interactive mode where it would be suitable for integrating into a larger analysis pipeline for the systematic processing of large numbers of files. However, it is important to note that the evaluations must be taken in the context of what you expect from your library, as a 'normal' sample as far as FastQC is concerned is random and diverse, and some experiments may be expected to produce libraries which are biased in particular ways.","system":"experiment_1e","overall_rating":1,"Is an answer provided?":"","The answer is relevant to the question (regardless of whether the details are correct or not).":"","This answer is useful and helpful to address this question.":"","The answer contains enough information for the question.":"","The answer completely answers the whole question (e.g., it covers every aspect of the question).":"","The answer is missing specific details from the document.":"","The answer is wordy (e.g., unnecessarily long or contains unnecessary words).":"","The answer is easy to read and comprehend.":"","The answer contains inaccurate information (e.g., information that is made up or not true).":"","The answer contains information not found in the document (e.g., information that does not exist in this document).":"","The answer contains irrelevant information (e.g., information that is irrelevant).":"","The answer has been written by an expert.":"","I can trust this answer":""}]},"q6":{"text":"How do you save a report in FastQC?","index":0,"answers":[{"text":"To save a report in FastQC, you need to select \"File\" from the main menu and then choose \"Save Report\". By default, the report will be created using the name of the fastq file with _fastqc.zip appended to the end. The report will be created for whichever file tab was active when the menu option was selected. The report file which is created is actually a zip file. When uncompressed this will create a folder with the same name as the report file. Inside this will be a series of files, but the one to look at is the fastqc_report.html file which links to the other files in the report.","system":"experiment_1e","overall_rating":1,"Is an answer provided?":"","The answer is relevant to the question (regardless of whether the details are correct or not).":"","This answer is useful and helpful to address this question.":"","The answer contains enough information for the question.":"","The answer completely answers the whole question (e.g., it covers every aspect of the question).":"","The answer is missing specific details from the document.":"","The answer is wordy (e.g., unnecessarily long or contains unnecessary words).":"","The answer is easy to read and comprehend.":"","The answer contains inaccurate information (e.g., information that is made up or not true).":"","The answer contains information not found in the document (e.g., information that does not exist in this document).":"","The answer contains irrelevant information (e.g., information that is irrelevant).":"","The answer has been written by an expert.":"","I can trust this answer":""}]},"q7":{"text":"What are compressed and uncompressed files?","index":0,"answers":[{"text":"A compressed file is a file that has been reduced in size using a compression algorithm.

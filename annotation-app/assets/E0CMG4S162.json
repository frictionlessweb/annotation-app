His mother, who was the brightest spot in his childhood, managed to earn a subsistence living for them by sewing, but she slowly succumbed to mental illness and was confined to an asylum when Charlie was 7 years old. Charlie and his older half-brother Sidney were relegated to a workhouse, and in later years, Charlie lived with his alcoholic father and stepmother. Sidney left home first, working on a sailing ship and later on the stage, opening the door for Charlie to follow in his footsteps later. However, there was a bright spot in Chaplin's 9th year when he toured with a stage company, the 8 Lancashire Lads, with a kindhearted couple who led the troupe and gave Chaplin his first taste of stage life. At the age of 12, Charlie's father died quite young, and Charlie provided for himself as best he could, desperate to avoid returning to the workhouse, until Sidney returned home. Overall, Charlie Chaplin's childhood was marked by poverty, family instability, and periods of institutionalization for both himself and his mother.","overall_rating":1,"Does this answer provide enough information for the question?":"","Does this answer provide inaccurate information?":"","Does this answer provide information not found in the document?":"","Does this answer completely answer the whole question?":"","Is it easy to read this answer?":"","Is this answer relevant to the question?":"","Do you feel the answer is wordy?":"","Do you believe or trust this answer?":"","Do you need more details?":"","Are there any new ideas or concepts in this answer that make you somewhat surprised?":"","Is this answer useful or helpful to address the question?":"","Do you think this answer has been written by an expert?":""},{"text":"Charlie Chaplin's childhood was marked by poverty and hardship.

In 1917, he began building his own studio and signed with First National, which gave him complete control over every step of his films. In 1918, he married for the first time, to Mildred Harris. In 1919, he formed United Artists with his closest friend Douglas Fairbanks and Fairbanks' wife, screen legend Mary Pickford, in a successful effort to keep the major studios from monopolizing and controlling all aspects of production. In 1923, he began work on his first feature-length film, The Gold Rush. In 1936, he released Modern Times, which was followed by The Great Dictator in 1940, a film that made fun of Adolph Hitler himself. In 1959, the Chaplin Revue was released, to worldwide acclaim. In 1964, he published his autobiography, which he humbly titled 'My Autobiography'. In 1974, he published another book, 'My Life in Pictures.' The next year, he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II, and became Sir Charles Spencer Chaplin. These milestones shaped his personal life in various ways. For instance, in 1919, Chaplin suffered a terrible loss when his and Mildred's infant child was born horribly deformed and died after only 3 days. He sought solace in his work, alienating his wife even more. In 1958, Edna Purviance, an old friend, died, and Chaplin's name was removed from Los Angeles' Walk of Fame.","overall_rating":1,"Does this answer provide enough information for the question?":"","Does this answer provide inaccurate information?":"","Does this answer provide information not found in the document?":"","Does this answer completely answer the whole question?":"","Is it easy to read this answer?":"","Is this answer relevant to the question?":"","Do you feel the answer is wordy?":"","Do you believe or trust this answer?":"","Do you need more details?":"","Are there any new ideas or concepts in this answer that make you somewhat surprised?":"","Is this answer useful or helpful to address the question?":"","Do you think this answer has been written by an expert?":""},{"text":"Charlie Chaplin's career was marked by several milestones.

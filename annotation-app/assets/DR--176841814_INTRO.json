          "text": "The requirements and expectations for students in the Honors Degree Program are outlined in the Honors College Handbook . Students must register for and complete at least twelve hours of solid academic courses each long semester . During their first two years, students are required to attend one of the Honors College’s educational enrichment activities per semester . Students are expected to plan ahead so that they can take advantage of as many Honors core courses as possible . Honors classes are limited to a maximum of around twenty-five students and are often smaller, and they tend to be conducted more along the lines of an upper-level seminar  . The Honors College offers Honors sections of most core courses, special Honors seminars, as well as a number of upper-level Honors options  . Students will receive up to six hours of Honors credit . Students will either complete 15 hours of Honors core courses or 12 hours of Honors core courses and a sophomore three-hour Honors Seminar . Until completion of the 15-hour Honors Core, in order to remain an active member of the Honors College, students must complete at least one honors course each semester or receive special permission to be excused from this requirement from the director . The requirement for remaining in the Honors Core is an overall Tarleton GPA of 3.0 or higher and a 3.0 or higher in the Honors classes . Honors classes are typically taught by distinguished senior faculty, and they emphasize discussion and student participation, primary sources and monographs over textbooks, special lab equipment, student projects and research, and essay exams over multiple choice  . The Honors Degree Program offers a number of $4,000 and $1,000 scholarships, which are awarded on a competitive basis . After their first semester, students are not required to be advised by the Honors Office, but they are required to take at least one honors course each semester until they complete the 15-hour Honors Core . The Honors College hosts several educational enrichment activities each semester . The Honors College provides many opportunities for cultural and educational enrichment . Eligible students include students who have completed Tarleton’s Honors Core, students who have completed a lower-division Honors component comparable to Tarleton’s Honors Core at a community college or another four-year institution, or students with a 3.2 or higher overall GPA (transfer students or continuing Tarleton students) . Generally speaking, Honors classes don’t require a greater quantity of work, but the work is more challenging and intellectually stimulating . Students are expected to make a contribution to the Honors community and to the academic excellence of the University .",

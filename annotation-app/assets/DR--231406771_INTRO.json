If there is not yet a safe disposal box nearby, check back soon.\n- Don't flush pills or liquid medication down the toilet or drain. Flushing pollutes drinking water and could harm aquatic life.\n- Mix medicine with something that cannot be eaten, such as cat litter or coffee grounds, to prevent accidental or intentional misuse of medicine by children or animals.\n- Wrap the mixture in another material, such as newsprint or a paper sack, or place medicine in sealable containers (cans, plastic bags).\n- Throw in the trash on the day your garbage is collected.\n- Place syringes and other injectables in a sturdy, puncture-resistant container with a screw-on cap. Empty laundry detergent bottles work well.\n- Only for used fentanyl or Duragesic pain patches: fold in half, sticky side together, and flush down the toilet. These patches are dangerous if not flushed immediately after use.\n- Take all other unopened patches to a Take-Back location.",

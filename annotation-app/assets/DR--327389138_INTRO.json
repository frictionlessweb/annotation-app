Increasing climatic unpredictability exacerbates all pressures on the agricultural production systems of Southeast Asia . Food security is challenged by the low and dramatically falling cultivated land per capita, especially in the most productive areas of the region . To address these challenges, CCAFS has initiated activities in South Asia, East Africa, and West Africa . The program is collaborating with the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) and all 15 CGIAR research centers, as well as with other CGIAR thematic research programs . The FAO Economics and Policy Innovations for Climate-Smart Agriculture (EPIC) Programme and the CCAFS are working together with NOMAFSI to organize Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA) investment proposals and policy recommendations for Vietnam, based on future climate and socio-economic scenarios . The FAO/CCAFS scenarios process has focused on contextual drivers of change for Climate Smart Agriculture â€“ climate change and socio-economic changes . In South East Asia, socio-economic and climate scenarios have been developed at the subcontinental level up to 2050 . To meaningfully assess the feasibility of Climate Smart Agriculture investment proposals, these have to be examined in the context of multiple scenarios representing diverse future socio-economic and climate developments .",

Scenarios also allow for the capturing of uncertainties and systems complexity in a coherent and plausible yet surprising and challenging fashion. By using scenarios to test investment proposals, actors can engage in a dialogue about future uncertainties which results in an active, critical understanding of the proposals, and therefore leads to co-ownership of these plans and will make it more likely that they are truly informed by regional perspectives.",

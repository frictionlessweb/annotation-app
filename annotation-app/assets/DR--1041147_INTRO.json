The considerations guiding the MOU include the need for practical action to provide a disincentive against Irregular Migration, People Smuggling syndicates and transnational crime and intended to promote orderly migration and humanitarian solutions; the need to take account of the protection needs of persons who have moved irregularly who may be seeking asylum; the impact that an arrangement could have in providing a disincentive for Irregular Migration and creating increased protection opportunities for those in need of international protection; and the need to ensure, so far as is possible, that no benefit is gained through circumventing regular migration arrangements. Additionally, the MOU includes establishing a processing center for Transferees, ensuring that Transferees are treated with dignity and respect and that relevant human rights standards are met, developing special arrangements for vulnerable cases including unaccompanied minors, not expelling or returning a transferee to another country where his or her life or freedom would be threatened, making an assessment of whether or not a transferee is covered by the definition of refugee, not sending a transferee to another country where there is a real risk of torture or cruel treatment, establishing a Joint Committee with responsibility for the oversight of practical arrangements required to implement this MOU, and resolving any differences arising under or in relation to this Memorandum amicably and by consultation.",

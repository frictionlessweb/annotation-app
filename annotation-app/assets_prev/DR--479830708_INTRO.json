However, Fusion Garage secretly planned to hijack the joint venture in violation of its fiduciary duties to TechCrunch and CrunchPad . Fusion Garage led TechCrunch and CrunchPad to believe that the three were collaborators working earnestly on a common joint venture, but instead, Fusion Garage engaged in a six-month \"guerrilla marketing\" campaign as \"TabCo\" and relaunched a new version of the CrunchPad/JooJoo as the \"Grid10\" in 2011  .",

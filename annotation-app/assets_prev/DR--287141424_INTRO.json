It is a very popular 11-16 comprehensive school, newly established on what was a teacher-training and development centre, to provide for the needs of students in that area of the London Borough of Ealing . The main strengths and weaknesses of the school are not specified in the sources, but there are multiple sources that mention \"main strengths and weaknesses\"                      . However, one source mentions that the school's leadership is very good in the way it strikes an effective balance between clear accountability through the school organization and a measure of autonomy at middle management level that encourages initiative and innovation . Additionally, the school actively involves students through seeking, valuing, and acting on their views, and students are given a good level of responsibility .",

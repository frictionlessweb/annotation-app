The fitness of a strategy is determined by its ex post utility, which can be calculated using equation (17):\n\n(17)\n\nwhere dt is the only state variable, a and b are parameters that can be derived from the underlying parameters of the model, and pi is the price of the risky asset in period i.\n\n- Lettau's mutation operator involves flipping each bit according to a fixed probability. The mutation rate is slowly decayed over time, so that eventually mutation probabilities go to zero. This is a form of cooling down the learning rates as time progresses.\n\nOverall, Lettau's framework involves using a genetic algorithm to learn the optimal portfolio strategy in a financial market, with agents' policy functions simplified to the optimal linear functional form.

The biggest challenge for startups entering or already operating in this area is a lack of awareness and understanding of the industry. Startups with little or no prior knowledge of the insurance industry struggle to quickly demonstrate their value proposition and make tangible impacts. \n\nHowever, collaboration between old and new is not always straightforward. Some traditional insurers are more than 300 years old, whereas many InsurTechs are less than 300 days old. This can lead to significant challenges and differences surrounding culture, workforce, agility, and technology. \n\nClever startups will support insurers on their transformation journeys by taking conscious decisions over speed of implementation and engagement. Partnerships between insurers, startups, and other collaborators should be built on a win-win basis. Identifying additional \u2018wins\u2019 greatly improves the chances of success. The startup might greatly benefit from access to a subset of the insurer\u2019s customer base to test out its propositions and capabilities, for instance. Equally, the insurer will most likely find additional accelerators for enhancing customer value, propositions, and operations.\n\nThe insurance partners gained valuable insights into the new technologies coming into the market, and were also able to develop and enhance their innovation agendas. Accenture\u2019s Technology Vision for Insurance 2016 revealed that 44 percent of insurers across the world intend to pursue digital initiatives with startups from the insurance industry over the next two years. \n\nIn conclusion, startups and mature industries can bring out the best in one another by collaborating and building partnerships on a win-win basis. Startups can bring new technologies and innovative ideas to the table, while mature industries can provide valuable insights and access to a large customer base. By working together, both parties can benefit and ultimately enhance customer value, propositions, and operations.",

Scenarios are used as a policy tool for adaptation planning, and they are developed by combining socio-economic and climate scenarios at the subcontinental level up to 2050.

However, despite the existence of this legislation, sexual harassment remains a persistent problem in Australian workplaces. The SDA imposes a vicarious liability on employers for the sexual harassment of their employees by other employees or third parties, unless the employer can establish that it took all reasonable steps to prevent the harassment from occurring. While there is no definition of \u2018reasonable steps\u2019 contained in the SDA, \u2018reasonable steps\u2019 may include having an internal policy that prohibits sexual harassment, conducting training on what constitutes sexual harassment and dealing with sexual harassment complaints in an appropriate manner. Maurice Blackburn, a law firm, has suggested that the SDA should impose a positive obligation on employers to take all reasonable steps to prevent sexual harassment occurring in the workplace, whether an incident has occurred or not. Additionally, Maurice Blackburn has suggested that State and Territory WHS authorities be explicitly authorised to investigate and impose sanctions on employers who have breached their duty to provide safe and without risk workplaces, particularly in the context of sexual harassment.",

Additionally, better settlement data (including on post-mediation outcomes) needs to be obtained, maintained, and published by the AHRC so that complainants can understand that there are available remedies which sound in real compensation being negotiated that may go some way to compensating the victims of sexual harassment for the hurt, humiliation, distress, and financial losses that they have suffered.",
